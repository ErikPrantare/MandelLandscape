#Prefer smaller tasks
#Do development in seperate branch, merge into develop after passing review
#Final commit should be done with short description as commit message
#Merge into develop with rebase

#Follow template in Trello to add task
#Add Story Points power up to represent a rough linear scale of time where
#1 is real quick and 10 is a BIG task

#Add a comment with the branch name when you move task to REVIEW
