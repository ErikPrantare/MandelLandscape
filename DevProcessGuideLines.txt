#Prefer smaller tasks
#Do development in seperate branch, merge into develop after passing review
#Merge into develop with --no-ff flag to preserve correct timestamp

#Follow template in Trello to add task
#Add Story Points power up to represent a rough linear scale of time where
#1 is real quick and 10 is a BIG task

#Use git rebase ONLY with offline branches
#NEVER force push to remote repositories
#In general, do not cause history changes in remotes

#At the end of each sprint, remove dead/finished/inactive branches
#Only change formating at the beginning of a sprint
