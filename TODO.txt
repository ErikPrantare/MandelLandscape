Move source files to src
Move window resolution to global variable

Move terrain rendering to method

Remove camera height stuttering
-ideas:
-multiple sample points for height calculation
-cap movement speed in y direction

1. Make terrain mesh more dense near middle
2. Move terrain height calculation to vertex shader
1 && 2 => Make mesh height calculation seamlessly change with movement
